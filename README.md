## About Me 🚀

I’m a **Software Engineer** working at the intersection of **enterprise systems**, **full-stack development**, and **secure backend architecture**.

My core strength is building **real-world business software** — from **ERP customizations in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central** to **modern full-stack applications** that integrate with complex systems.

I enjoy environments where I can **go deep**, understand *why* things work, and then build solutions that are **clean, scalable, and hard to break**.

- 🌱 Currently learning: **Advanced Backend Architecture, Cybersecurity**
- 🔭 Working on: **Business Central extensions, ERP workflows, and Full-Stack Development (projects)**
- 🌍 Languages:
  - **Programming:** AL, JavaScript, SQL, C#, HTML, CSS, PHP,Python  
  - **Human:** English
- 📫 How to reach me: **oladsimeji@gmail.com**
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like dissecting complex systems until they feel obvious — ERP processes, security models, or production costing.
